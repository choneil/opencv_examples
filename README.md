just trying to put together some 'helper' functions or opencv examples for fall. in mind: geometry overlays, data print overlays (positions, speeds, other?). 
potentially interested in using code and pngs used to generate video in the directory over there to put together a lil framework for others to generate videos for testing and proof of concept.
